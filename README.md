# Hey there, I'm Stefano!

I’m a developer focused on building **platform infrastructure**, **cloud automation**, and **tools for game teams**.  
I currently work as a **Platform Infrastructure Engineer** at **Raw Power Labs**, helping keep production systems reliable, scalable, and cost-efficient.  
My background is in **Machine Learning / AI**, and I still enjoy experimenting with AI systems—especially where they intersect with games and developer tooling.  
I like turning messy problems into clean systems: from pipelines and observability to internal platforms that make teams faster.

## What I work with

- **Cloud & Platform Engineering** (AWS, infrastructure automation, internal platforms)
- **DevOps / CI/CD** (pipelines, release workflows, developer experience)
- **Observability & Reliability** (monitoring, logging, incident readiness)
- **Cost Optimization & Governance** (finops, configuration hygiene, access patterns)
- **AI systems for tooling** (practical experiments, not hype)

- I enjoy the intersection of creativity + systems (tools, pipelines, performance)
- I probably have more dev tools installed than games
